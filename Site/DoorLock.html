          <br>The wifi module I was using, ESP8266, was to weak to reach my wifi router, 
          <br>and would sometimes make a connection othertimes it wouldn't. 
          <br>I needed a more reliable second means of entering other than the fingerprint sensor,
          <br>so I decided to implement a matrix keypad as shown*/
